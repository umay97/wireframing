## What is wireframing ? ## 
Wireframing is a crucial step in the design process, serving as a blueprint or skeletal framework of a website or application. It outlines the basic structure and layout without delving into detailed design elements like colors, fonts, or images. Wireframes focus on the placement of elements, navigation flow, and overall user interface structure
## 🎯 Why Wireframing Matters

Wireframing helps teams:

- Clarify **content layout** and **user flow**.
- Focus on **usability** and **navigation** without the distraction of colors or detailed graphics.
- Catch potential **design issues early**, before investing time in development.
- Align stakeholders and developers on a **shared vision**.

## 🔧 When to Use Wireframes

Wireframes are most useful in the early stages of product design, especially when:
- Defining user requirements
- Planning new features or pages
- Designing user interfaces for mobile or web apps

## 🧩 Key Elements in a Wireframe

### 🗂️ Layout Structure
Defines how content and features are arranged on the page.  
📌 *Example:* A homepage might have a header at the top, a main content area in the center, and a footer at the bottom. This helps users understand the site structure at a glance.

### 🧭 Navigation
Indicates how users will move from one page or section to another.  
📌 *Example:* A navigation bar at the top with links to "Home", "Bookings", and "Contact Us" allows users to move easily through the system.

### 📄 Content Placement
Shows where specific elements like text, images, and videos will go.  
📌 *Example:* A booking page wireframe might include a calendar on the left, a booking form on the right, and a "Submit" button at the bottom.

### ⚙️ Functionality
Outlines interactive elements and user actions.  
📌 *Example:* Wireframing a “Checkout” button that triggers a payment form helps ensure that this function is visible and usable early in the design.
