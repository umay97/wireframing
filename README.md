## What is wireframing ? ## 
Wireframing is a crucial step in the design process, serving as a blueprint or skeletal framework of a website or application. It outlines the basic structure and layout without delving into detailed design elements like colors, fonts, or images. Wireframes focus on the placement of elements, navigation flow, and overall user interface structure
## 🎯 Why Wireframing Matters

Wireframing helps teams:

- Clarify **content layout** and **user flow**.
- Focus on **usability** and **navigation** without the distraction of colors or detailed graphics.
- Catch potential **design issues early**, before investing time in development.
- Align stakeholders and developers on a **shared vision**.

## 🔧 When to Use Wireframes

Wireframes are most useful in the early stages of product design, especially when:
- Defining user requirements
- Planning new features or pages
- Designing user interfaces for mobile or web apps

## 🧩 Key Elements in a Wireframe

### 🗂️ Layout Structure
Defines how content and features are arranged on the page.  
📌 *Example:* A homepage might have a header at the top, a main content area in the center, and a footer at the bottom. This helps users understand the site structure at a glance.

### 🧭 Navigation
Indicates how users will move from one page or section to another.  
📌 *Example:* A navigation bar at the top with links to "Home", "Bookings", and "Contact Us" allows users to move easily through the system.

### 📄 Content Placement
Shows where specific elements like text, images, and videos will go.  
📌 *Example:* A booking page wireframe might include a calendar on the left, a booking form on the right, and a "Submit" button at the bottom.

### ⚙️ Functionality
Outlines interactive elements and user actions.  
📌 *Example:* Wireframing a “Checkout” button that triggers a payment form helps ensure that this function is visible and usable early in the design.

## 🧾 Types of Wireframes

Wireframes come in different levels of detail and complexity. The two most common types are:

### 🪶 Low-Fidelity Wireframes
Low-fidelity wireframes are **simple, sketch-like** representations of a user interface. They focus on **layout and structure** without any detailed design elements like color, font, or images.

**Typical Characteristics:**
- Basic shapes (boxes, lines, placeholders)
- Black and white or grayscale
- No real content — uses lorem ipsum or labels like "Image Here"
- Fast to create and easy to modify

**When to Use:**
- Early stages of design
- Brainstorming and ideation
- Quick feedback from stakeholders

📌 *Example:* A rough sketch showing where the header, navigation bar, and booking form would appear on a page.

### 🎨 High-Fidelity Wireframes
High-fidelity wireframes are **more detailed and polished**, often resembling the final product in layout and content. They include real text, fonts, colors, and sometimes interactivity.

**Typical Characteristics:**
- Realistic layout and spacing
- Detailed UI components (buttons, form fields, icons)
- Close to the final design

**When to Use:**
- Later stages of design
- Developer handoff
- Usability testing with end users

📌 *Example:* A fully labeled and styled wireframe of a booking confirmation page, showing exact button placement and user flow.

## 🧾 Identifying the Type of Wireframe Used Here

> This wireframe is a **low-fidelity wireframe**, designed to focus on the **basic layout and structure** of the booking system interface. It uses simple shapes and labels to communicate where elements will go, without any design styling. This helps validate functionality and user flow early in the design process, before investing in detailed UI work.
